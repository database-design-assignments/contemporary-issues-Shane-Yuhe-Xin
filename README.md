# Apple's fight with Facebook Over New Data Privacy Policy
I want to present the two articles that talk about debate between Apple and Facebook over the newly published privacy policy on IOS. The new policy asks every apps on IOS to ask for permission before they track the user data accross different apps. Though the new policy has been delayed to apply on IOS.14, Apple's new privacy policy has already caused a defense from Facebook, claiming that the new policy is benefiting Apple itself, as a hidden agenda, instead of benefitting the customers. In this two articles, the authors have different oppinions on whether Apple is going to protect privacy better than before. 

## Article 1

In NYT's [Goliath vs. Goliath](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/19/opinion/facebook-apple-privacy.html), Bensinger briefly discusses the development of this debate, and then talks about the future of the data privacy. Apple claims that this new change is made for the right of 
the customer, that users always have the right to control their data usage. Facebook, on the other hand, defends its position by claiming 
that the data collections are only for advertisement to target more precisely on customers.

Despite the widespread of this debate, Bensinger still thinks customer's situation won't be improved much. Because of the lack of regulations on data privacy, the debate is only happened between corporates. After all, this is essentially a law question about the data usage right of the customers. He believes that at least before the federal issues enough data privacy laws, like Europe, data of the customers isn't going to be better protected as expected. 

This article is basically talking about the obstacles customers' facing in terms of their privacy rights. I agree with this piece of article because this opinion issues from a practicle practice. We have to notice that Apple is a for-profit company, and not every action it has been taken is for-customer. 


## Article 2
Contrary to the claims made by NYU Opinion, Evans from the Computerworld takes an opposite side. [Thoughts on Apple versus Facebook](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3601691/thoughts-on-apple-versus-facebook.html) Evans believes that the change made by Apple has a tremendous effect on shaping our future of data privacy, and Apple's claim is well-justified-- Apple is not banning the advertisement in the social media, rather, Apple gives customers a choice to allow the tracking across apps(or not).

Because Apple is one of the industry leader, it will force most of the companies to change their way of accessing personaized data. Therefore, not only the entire market, but also the customer will become more logical and ethical, preferring a healthier, more data-secured market environment. 

I believe that this author is being optimistic about this topic. We haven't really seen what effect this change will bring because the new policy is not yet applied. Also, with only the effort of one firm, it is hard to imagine such a policy change will benifit the entire group of customers.
